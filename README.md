# RFID-Controlled-Smart-Class-Monitoring
This is a hardware project, a prototype of a smart classroom attendance system, which is controlled and maintained using RFID chips. All students will have RFID tags with them. Using the tags, the students will enter/leave the classroom, which automatically takes their attendance as well.

Design, pin diagram and other instructions on implementing the project is avaiable in the ProjectDetails.pdf file.
